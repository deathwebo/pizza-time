# Pizza Time

Application for users to select pizza sizes with their topping of choice.

Created using React, Redux, GraphQL and Typescript

## SETUP

Since this application is based on the `create-react-app` script the only requirement to run the project is to execute the command `yarn start` or `npm run start`.

## TODO

* Add bulma to style things up
