# Pizza Time

Application for users to select pizza sizes with their topping of choice.

Created React, Redux, GraphQL and Typescript. Using the `create-react-app` tool for a quick setup.

## Live demo

There's a live demo running in https://deathwebo.github.io/pizza-time but it looks like 
the graphql server is not accepting requests from a source other than localhost. 
So the pizza sizes are not currently loading.

## SETUP

## Requirements

* node and npm installed

## Steps

* Clone this repo locally
* Change directory to the newly created repository directory
* Execute `yarn install` or `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Execute `yarn start` or `npm run install` to initialize the local instance
* Visit the provided url, `http://localhost:3000` by default
* Order delicious pizza!

## TODO

* Add bulma to style things up
